    <!--Ronnie Holmes dedication to the Great8-->
        <p><em>This is for the Great8.   As one of the best motivators in the history of the universe once said- "I can, I will, I must".</em></p>

    <!--Marketing pitch for employers to buy in-->
        <p>As an employer who interviews candidates that are highly qualified for the job, don't you want to know the real persona of who's sitting accross the table from you tomorrow?  What makes them tick? Everyone's on a journey and now you can consider your prospective employee's LegacY.<p>

    <!--Marketing pitch for job seekers to buy in-->
        <p>You want that sharp edge going into that interview...the edge that lets everyone know your LegacY and what you're made of.  You're amazing and they're gonna know it!</p>

<!--Animate the avatar.  Not in a cartoon style like a Bitmoji, a more serious tone should be animated. Examples: Strolling down the street dancing the duggy or floss.  Posing for the camera. Options to chose clothes, hats, shoes, jewelry, and accessories are standard in all avatar creators and should be included in LegacY as well.-->

    <!--No resume wanted at bottom of page.  This is just as valueable as a resume.  Could add option of attaching resume in a small iframe type box at bottom of page to click on.  Maybe add Legacy creed somewhere on first page???  Add music to website as well???  Add clickable aside for linking other profiles such as LinkedIn???-->
